### Running Jasmine Tests
We won't run the tests from the command line.  Instead we'll run them in the browser, by opening the file `SpecRunner.html`.  This HTML file loads the Jasmine JavaScript library, the application code that we'll write, and the files containing the tests.  It runs the tests and then displays the outcome of the tests in the browser.
